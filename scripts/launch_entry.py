"""Container entry for `ros2 launch`: turn SIGTERM into the SIGINT launch honours.

Humble's `ros2 launch` shuts its child processes down cleanly on SIGINT but NOT
on SIGTERM: on SIGTERM it cancels its own event loop and exits, orphaning every
node it started (its own log says so). `docker stop` sends SIGTERM, so this runs
as PID 1 and forwards it as SIGINT. It is Python rather than bash because a
non-interactive bash starts background children with SIGINT ignored, which
silently defeats the forwarding.
